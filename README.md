# AI Document Processing Platform

An event-driven, scalable AI document processing platform that ingests, processes, and enables intelligent querying over large collections of documents using OCR, Kafka pipelines, and MCP-based AI agents.

This platform is designed to support **multiple document types** (resumes, legal cases, medical reports, invoices, articles, etc.) and provides both **document-level and collection-level intelligence**.
